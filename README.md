# Seawolf
A project in CSE307. It is a programming language created by using the Python framework TPG. It is a script language capable to declare variables, define functions, and run functions recursively.

SeawolfBase.py has all the basic features except function and running function recursively.
Seawolf.py has minimum code just to run the remaining features because I did not want all those extra code when I was working on the homework.
If you want to see the full feature, you may combine(union) the two.
